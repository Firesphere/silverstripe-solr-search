# Elevation

To promote certain results over others, you can use Elevation (currently a work in progress).

## Why use elevation?

If you need to put a certain page above another for certain search queries, you should use
elevation. It is similar to [boosting](./02-Boosting.md), but for a result rather than a field.

An example of this is a e-commerce store. As a shop, you want the product pages themselves to appear
above the warranty pages, even if they have equivalent relevance scores.

### NOTE
Elevation is currently a work in progress and not yet available for the general public.
Have a look at [Elevation WIP](https://github.com/Firesphere/silverstripe-solr-search/pull/56) for more details.
