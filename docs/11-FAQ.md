# FAQ

### What do you mean not fast enough?

All indexing, as well as the search, require disk space. If the disk can not respond fast enough to a write,
either PHP or Java will stop and throw an error

### Do you support synonyms

Yes! Including US to UK spelling synonyms by default!

### Fast?

Yes, very fast

### Compatible with the Fulltext Search Module?

99% and counting, does that work for you? Have a look at the compatibility module

### Why do I need to name my index?

You have a name yourself, don't you? It makes sense to name the index too.

### Only File storage?

Hold your horses, this is a beta stage project, more storage options to come!
