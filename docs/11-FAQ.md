# FAQ

### What do you mean not fast enough?

All indexing, as well as the search, require disk space. If the disk can not respond fast enough to a write,
either PHP or Java will stop and throw an error

### Do you support synonyms

Yes! Including US to UK spelling synonyms by default!

### Fast?

Yes, very fast

### Compatible with the Fulltext Search Module?

99% and counting, does that work for you? Have a look at the compatibility module

### Why do I need to name my index?

You have a name yourself, don't you? It makes sense to name the index too.

### Only File storage?

Hold your horses, this is a beta stage project, more storage options to come!

### I would like a feature to be added!

I would like an issue to be created

### Dealing with errors

Especially when using facets, you should not redeclare fields to be filterable as well. If you run in to an error 
saying you have duplicate fields, check your configuration that e.g. FilterFields does not have an overlap with FacetFields, etc.
