# Elevation

To promote certain results over others, Elevation is a work in progress.

## Why use elevation

If you need to put a certain page above another for certain search queries, you should use
elevation.

An example of this is a webshop. As a shop, you want the results for the products to appear
above the results for a Warranty page for said product. To improve sales.

Elevation is just what you need for that.

### NOTE
Elevation is currently a work in progress and not yet available for the general public.
Have a look at [Elevation WIP](https://github.com/Firesphere/silverstripe-solr-search/pull/56) for more details.
