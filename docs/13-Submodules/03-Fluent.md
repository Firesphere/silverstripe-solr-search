# [Fluent submodule](https://github.com/Firesphere/silverstripe-fluent-solr)

With the [Fluent submodule](https://github.com/Firesphere/silverstripe-fluent-solr),
languages are separately indexed so that a user will only find results in their language.

## Known issues

- Global, non-language specific search is not functional yet.
- Indexes intended to contain multiple languages may index one language, and override with
the next one if configured incorrectly.
