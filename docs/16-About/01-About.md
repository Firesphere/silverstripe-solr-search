# About

This Solr search module is aimed at a more modern, modular approach to searching with Solr,
to replace the existing FTS module that has some shortcomings and problems with features
that Solr does offer, but aren't supported.

It is maintained by:
* Simon `Firesphere` Erkelens
* Marco `Sheepy` Hermo
