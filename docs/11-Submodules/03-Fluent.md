# [Fluent submodule](https://github.com/Firesphere/silverstripe-fluent-solr)

With the [Fluent submodule](https://github.com/Firesphere/silverstripe-fluent-solr), languages are separately indexed.
This means you don't have to worry about if the results have the right language settings.

## Known issues

- Global, non-language specific search is not functional yet.
- Indexes may index only one language, and override with the next one when misconfigured.
